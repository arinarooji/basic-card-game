# WARLORDS: A Card Game
### Dual your CPU with various hero and power up cards!

### Guide
_________
#### Getting Started
- Visit https://arinarooji.github.io/warlords-card-game/

#### Rules of Warlords
- At the start of the game, you are dealt four cards: two **hero cards** and two **power cards**.
- Each round, you must equip a selected **Hero Card** with a **Power Card**, boosting your hero's overall level.
- Your hero's overall level can be calculated by simply adding both of your selected card numbers located in the top left corner.
- When you're equipped for battle, you will notice the **Battle** button glow red. Click the **Battle** button when you're ready.
- When you send a hero with a designated power out to battle, both of those cards are consumed. On the next round, you will receive another hero and power card.

#### Winning the War
- The goal for each round is to have a higher level than your opponent. The hero with the highest level wins the round.
- The losing side receives damage, which is represented with the health bars at the top *(CPU's, red color)* and bottom *(Player's, green color)* of the screen.
- Whoever's health bar depletes first has lost the war, while the other is deemed the warlord!
